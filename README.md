Same application built again ground-up at [here](https://github.com/saisandeepvaddi/movie-search)

# Development

## Pre-requisite
- This app uses paid api from [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/). Hence, `REACT_APP_API_KEY` environment variable written in `.env` file at the root directory is not committed here. Please check out the website for details. It's not expensive.
